* Nix Factory
This project is my playground for building all kinds of Nixos Virtual Machines. Build process utilizes nixos-generators to (currently) build QEMU compatible images, for UTM to run.

** Usage
- build-iso.sh :: Create bootable iso using basic configuration
- build-vm.sh :: Create Nixos VM image, ready to be cloned and ran by QEMU (UTM)
- start-vm.sh :: With magic of AppleScript, make UTM create VM via CLI based on our prebuilt image, and return it's IP address

** Types of machines
- nixos :: Standard basic nixos image, with bare minimum configuration
